# Passoword-Protection-Application
This is my fun little and useful project. Which stores passwords with SHA 256 encryption.


This project will useful for person like me who forget passwords and usernames for various applications.

This application allows us to store Username and password and application name

It have 3 options A. Adding new password to Database
                  B. Update already saved password
                  C. Delete password from database
                  D. Get password using appname
I applied SHA 256 encryption to every password. For every password you have to give private key, and at the time of insert and same private key needed while getting that password.
Both private keys are matched then you will get correct password.

But it don't display password on screen, password is copied to clipboard you can paste directly in password input box.

# This is just like blue print of my idea I'll enhance it.
